Corpus Statistics Analyses (corstatana)
==========================

The goal here is to link voice, role, or talker diarization/detection system performance to characteristics of files and/or speakers on files. See
[this file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ef_lr6QAWSa8RKOvC6bbnb6ewd538bBHmQiMYjDRezE/edit) for explanation of the fields.


Look inside computation/scripts for the scripts, computation/results for the csv's describing files and speakers in files, and description/ for examples of analyses (e.g. https://github.com/jsalt-coml/corstatana/blob/master/description/system.pdf, visualization on p. 5)
