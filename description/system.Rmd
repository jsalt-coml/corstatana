## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r readin}

read.csv("../BabyTrain_ages.csv")->ages
ages[ages$corpus!="corpus",]->ages
ages$age=as.numeric(as.character(ages$age))

dat=NULL
for(j in dir("../extraction/results/"))  dat=rbind(dat,cbind(j,read.csv(paste0("../extraction/results/",j))))
dat$nb_diff_speakers=dat$nb_children+dat$nb_fem_ad+dat$nb_mal_ad+dat$nb_uncertain
merge(dat,ages,by.x="file",by.y="basename",all.x=T)->dat

summary(dat)

read.table("../AMI_MixHeadset__test__v1.txt", skip=2)->out
colnames(out)<-c("file","der","purity","coverage","total","correct","cor.pc","fa","fa.pc","miss","miss.pc","conf","conf.pc")
summary(out)

merge(out,dat)->out

library(lattice)

splom(out[c("fa.pc","miss.pc","conf.pc","prop_ovl_speech","avg_voc_dur")])
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
